We will continue to look at the the 7 principles of Lean Software Development as presented in `Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash`.

## Build quality in

During development, your goal is to build quality into the code from the start, not test it in later. You don’t focus on putting bugs/defects into a tracking system; you avoid creating defects in the first place. It takes a highly disciplined organization to do that.

There are two kinds of inspection: inspection after defects occur and inspection to prevent defects. If you really want quality, you don’t inspect after the fact, you control conditions so as not to allow defects in the first place.

Defect tracking systems are queues of partially done work. Too often we think that just because a defect is in a queue, it’s ok, we won’t lose track of it. But in the lean paradigm, queues are collection points for waste. The goal is to have no defects in the queue.
