On the last couple of days we had to test our application with a slow internet connection.
At first, I had no idea how to do that, but then I found out that you can do that pretty easy in Chrome.

Go to `Developer Console` -> `Network` tab.
There you will see a section where you can set the throttling for the requests.

The nice thing is that you already have some presets which will help you to test under common internet connections (e.g 3G - Good/Normal, 4G, GPRS, etc).
This is a particularly nice feature if you want to test your website for mobile usage.

I tested this only on Chrome, but I'm sure Firefox, or other major browsers, have a similar feature.
