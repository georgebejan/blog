## Deliver fast

We need to figure out how to deliver software so fast that our customers don’t have time to change their minds.

Don’t equate high speed with hacking. They are worlds apart. A fast-moving developing team must have excellent reflexes and a disciplined, stop-the-line culture. The reason for this is clear: you can’t sustain high speed unless you build quality in.

There are two ways to achieve high quality. You can slow down and be careful, or you can develop people who continually improve their process, build quality into their product, and develop the capability to repeatedly and reliably respond to their customers many times faster than their competitors.
