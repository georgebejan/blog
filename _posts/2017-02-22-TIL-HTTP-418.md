## [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol)

Apparently, there is an HTTP extension which allows you to interact with coffee pots.

Even though it started as an April Fool's Day joke, Mozilla got a number of [bug reports](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=46647) complaining about the lack of support for this protocol.

So, whenever you get a **418** HTTP error, it's the server saying `I'm a teapot`  

*P.S:* On 2014, the protocol was updated to support teapots, yay.
